[Z3] Falsifiable. Counter-example:
  s = String!val!0 :: |String|
[SBV] Counter-example might be bogus due to uninterpreted constants:
  [<no location info>] ==      :: [Char] -> [Char] -> Bool
  [<no location info>] reverse :: [Char] -> [Char]
[SBV] Failed. (Use option 'IgnoreFailure' to continue.)
