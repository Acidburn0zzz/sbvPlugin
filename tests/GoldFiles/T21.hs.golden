[Z3] Falsifiable. Counter-example:
  c =   Char!val!0 :: Char
  s = String!val!0 :: String
[SBV] Counter-example might be bogus due to uninterpreted constants:
  [<no location info>] == :: String -> String -> Bool
  [<no location info>] == :: Char -> Char -> Bool
[SBV] Failed. (Use option 'IgnoreFailure' to continue.)
